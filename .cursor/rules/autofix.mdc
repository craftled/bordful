Please use the Playwright MCP to open a browser to the URL I provide, check for any errors, and then automatically fix those errors in my codebase, then continue to iterate until all the errors are gone.

Always check if there are any red buttons or other openable boxes that should pop open a dialog, which will reveal more errors for you to fix.
