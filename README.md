## Getting Started

### 5-Minute Quick Start

Get your Bordful job board up and running in just 5 minutes with this step-by-step guide:

#### Prerequisites (2 minutes)

**1. Install an AI Code Editor (Highly Recommended)**
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.com/)** - AI-powered code editor with built-in chat
- **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/refer?referral_code=d886df4b0e)** - Agentic AI coding assistant
- **Why?** These editors will help you customize your job board with AI assistance, even if you're not a developer!

**2. Install Node.js OR Bun (Required)**

**Option A: Install Bun (Recommended - Faster)**
```bash
# Install Bun (all platforms)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Option B: Install Node.js**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (recommended for most users)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts

![Download Node.js](public/download-nodejs.jpg)

**Advanced Method - Command Line:**
```bash
# On macOS (if you have Homebrew)
brew install node

# On Windows (if you have Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs
```

**3. Verify Installation**
Open your Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

![Check Node and NPM Versions](public/check-node-and-npm-versions.jpg)

```bash
# If you installed Bun
bun --version   # Should show v1.0+ or higher

# If you installed Node.js
node --version  # Should show v18+ or higher
npm --version   # Should show 8+ or higher
```

‚úÖ **Success Check:** If you see version numbers, you're ready to continue!

#### Step 1: Get the Code (1 minute)

**Option A: Using GitHub's Web Interface (No Command Line Required)**
1. Go to [GitHub Import](https://github.com/new/import)
2. Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/craftled/bordful`
3. Choose your username and repository name (e.g., `my-job-board`)
4. Set visibility to "Private" (recommended)
5. Click "Begin import"
6. Once complete, click "Clone or download" ‚Üí "Download ZIP"
7. Extract the ZIP file to your desired folder
8. Open Terminal/Command Prompt in that folder and run: `bun install` or `npm install`

‚úÖ **Benefits**: Private by default, no Git knowledge required, ready for Vercel deployment

**Option B: Using Command Line (For Developers)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/craftled/bordful
cd bordful

# Install dependencies (choose one)
bun install    # Recommended - faster
# OR
npm install
```

> üí° **Tip**: Option A is perfect if you're not comfortable with Git or want to keep your code private from the start.

#### Step 2: Set Up Airtable Database (2 minutes)

**What is Airtable?** It's like a smart spreadsheet that will store your job listings. Think of it as your job board's database, but easier to use than Excel.

**Option A: Use Our Template (Recommended)**
1. Click this link: [Bordful Airtable Template](https://airtable.com/apprhCjWTxfG3JX5p/shrLqfxgbensCY393)
2. Click "Use this data" to add it to your Airtable workspace
3. **Find your Base ID:** Look at the URL in your browser - it will look like `https://airtable.com/appABC123DEFGHIJK/...`
4. Copy the part that starts with `app` (e.g., `appABC123DEFGHIJK`) - this is your Base ID

![Copy Airtable Base ID](public/copy-airtable-base-id.jpg)

‚úÖ **Success Check:** You should see a table with sample job listings and fields like "Title", "Company", "Status", etc.

**Option B: Create Your Own**
- See our [Airtable Setup Guide](/docs/getting-started/airtable-setup.md) for detailed instructions

#### Step 3: Get Your Airtable API Token (1 minute)

1. Go to [Airtable Tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens)
2. Click "Create new token"
3. Give it a name like "Bordful Job Board"
4. Add these scopes: `data.records:read`, `data.records:write`
5. Add your base from Step 2
6. Click "Create token" and copy the token (starts with `pat...`)

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables (1 minute)

**What are environment variables?** They're like secret settings that tell your job board how to connect to Airtable. Think of them as your app's private configuration.

**Step 4a: Copy the template file**
```bash
# Copy the example file to create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 4b: Edit your settings**
You need to edit the `.env` file with your actual values. Here's how:

**On Mac:** Open the file with TextEdit or your AI editor (Cursor/Windsurf)
**On Windows:** Open the file with Notepad or your AI editor (Cursor/Windsurf)

Replace the placeholder values with your real information:

```env
# REQUIRED: Your application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# REQUIRED: Airtable credentials (from steps 2 & 3)
AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=pat_your_actual_token_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app_your_actual_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Jobs

# OPTIONAL: Email provider for job alerts (you can add this later)
EMAIL_PROVIDER=encharge
ENCHARGE_WRITE_KEY=your_encharge_key_here
```

‚úÖ **Success Check:** Your `.env` file should have real values (starting with `pat_` and `app_`) instead of placeholder text.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Never share your `.env` file or commit it to Git! It contains your secret keys.

#### Step 5: Start Your Job Board (30 seconds)

```bash
# Start the development server (choose one)
bun run dev    # Recommended - faster
# OR
npm run dev
```

üéâ **That's it!** Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your job board in action.

**What you should see:**
- A homepage with job listings (from your Airtable template)
- Search and filter functionality
- Clean, professional design

![Bordful Job Board Running](public/bordful-localhost.jpg)

‚úÖ **Success Check:** If you see job listings on your homepage, congratulations! Your job board is working.

‚ùå **Not working?** Jump to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### What You Get Out of the Box

- ‚úÖ Fully functional job board with search and filtering
- ‚úÖ Responsive design that works on all devices
- ‚úÖ SEO-optimized with automatic sitemaps
- ‚úÖ RSS feeds for job listings
- ‚úÖ Admin-friendly Airtable interface for managing jobs
- ‚úÖ AI-assisted customization with Cursor/Windsurf editors

### Next Steps

1. **Add Your First Job**: 
   - Go to your Airtable base
   - Click the "+" button to add a new row
   - Fill in: Title, Company, Description, Status (set to "Published")
   - Refresh your job board to see it appear!

![Airtable Add New Job](public/airtable-add-new-job.jpg)

2. **Customize Your Brand**: 
   - Copy `config/config.example.ts` to `config/config.ts` and customize
   - üí° **Pro Tip**: Open the project in Cursor/Windsurf and ask the AI: "Help me customize the colors and branding for my job board"
3. **Set Up Job Alerts**: Add email provider credentials to enable job alert subscriptions
4. **Deploy to Production**: See our [Deployment Guide](#deployment-to-vercel) below

### Deployment to Vercel (Production)

Ready to go live? Deploy to Vercel in 3 steps:

#### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment

```bash
# Test your build locally first (choose one)
bun run build && bun run start    # Recommended
# OR
npm run build && npm run start
```

#### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

**If you used Option A (GitHub Import) in Step 1:**
1. Your code is already on GitHub - skip to step 2!

**If you used Option B (Command Line) in Step 1:**
1. Push your code to GitHub (without the `.env` file, `.gitignore` file already ignores it)

**For everyone:**
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Next.js project

#### Step 3: Add Environment Variables to Vercel

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
2. Add these variables one by one:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = https://your-domain.vercel.app
AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN = pat_your_token_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID = app_your_base_id_here
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME = Jobs
```

3. Click "Deploy" and your job board will be live!

### Troubleshooting

**Jobs not showing up?**
- Check your Airtable base has jobs with `status` field set to "Published"
- Verify your `AIRTABLE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` are correct in `.env`

**Package installation not working?**
- If using Bun: Make sure it's installed: run `bun --version`
- If using npm: Make sure Node.js is installed: run `node --version`
- Navigate to the correct folder before running the command
- On Windows, try running Command Prompt as Administrator

**Can't open Terminal/Command Prompt?**
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows:** Press `Windows key`, type "Command Prompt", press Enter

**Need help?** Check our [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation.md) for detailed instructions.
